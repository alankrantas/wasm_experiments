# WASM Experiments

This is some of my experiments on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/):

* [Golang + WASM](https://github.com/alankrantas/wasm_experiments/tree/main/go-wasm)
* [TinyGo + WASM](https://github.com/alankrantas/wasm_experiments/tree/main/tinygo-wasm) (and compared to pure JavaScript)
* [TinyGo + WASI + Node](https://github.com/alankrantas/wasm_experiments/tree/main/tinygo-wasi-node)
* [AssemblyScript + WASM](https://github.com/alankrantas/wasm_experiments/tree/main/assemblyscript)

Please note that these are just personal preliminary tests of how to use WASM resources in web pages.
